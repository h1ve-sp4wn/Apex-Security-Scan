Build the Docker image: In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing your script and Dockerfile. Then run:

docker build -t security-scan .

Run the Docker container: To run the container, execute:

docker run -e VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY="your_virustotal_api_key" security-scan

This command sets the VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY environment variable in the Docker container.

    If you have external tools such as nmap or testssl.sh that the script relies on, you need to install them within the container or use Docker's capabilities to run these commands. This can be done by modifying the Dockerfile to install these tools.

For example, to install nmap and testssl.sh in the container, modify the Dockerfile as follows:

    # Install nmap and testssl.sh
    RUN apt-get update && \
        apt-get install -y nmap && \
        apt-get install -y git && \
        git clone https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh.git /testssl

    Run the Docker container with external tools: Now, when you run the Docker container, it should have the necessary dependencies installed, including external tools like nmap and testssl.sh.

Notes for Docker:

    API Key Handling: The VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY should be set either as an environment variable when running the container or included in the script as a fallback.

    Example for environment variable:

    docker run -e VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY="your_virustotal_api_key" security-scan

    External Tools: If your script uses external tools like nmap or testssl.sh, make sure they are installed in your Docker container, as these tools may not be present in the base image by default.

Additional Considerations:

    File Logging: Your script logs data to a file (vulnerability_scan.log). If you want to persist the logs between Docker container restarts, you can mount a local directory to the container:

docker run -v /path/to/log/directory:/app/logs security-scan

Interactive Debugging: If you need to interact with the container, you can start an interactive shell:

    docker run -it security-scan /bin/bash

This will give you access to the container's shell for debugging and running commands manually.
